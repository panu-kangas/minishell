COMMAND NAMES (these are already OK in our minishell!!!)

EchO --> works
ExPort --> not working && error
Cd --> doesn't do anything, no error
UNset --> not working && error
PwD --> works
EnV --> works
eXit --> not working && error

Grep, sleep and cat all work, no matter if there's capital letters




MALLOC:

Test for malloc fail and see the exit code!!
And also bash error message.


UNSET:

_=/usr/bin/env 
--> cannot be unset



REDIRECT:

bash-3.2$ export TEST=
bash-3.2$ echo hello2 >$TEST
bash: $TEST: ambiguous redirect

bash-3.2$ >$NON_EXISTING_ENV_VAR
bash: $NON_EXISTING_ENV_VAR: ambiguous redirect

bash-3.2$ >
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

bash-3.2$ >""
bash: : No such file or directory 
--> THIS IS VERY WEIRD !!!!




ECHO:

echo # does somenthing special --> do I need to handle it...?
echo & does somenthing special --> do I need to handle it...?
echo * does somenthing special --> do I need to handle it...? --> probably not


EXPORT:

bash-3.2$ TEST =testi
--> Is ok, because TEST is a command...

export =testi
--> not okay


Numbers and special characters aren't "valid identifiers"... at least most of them, I need more research

Special tokens give different error (see below) --> THIS IS NOT NECESSARY, SINCE SPACIAL CHAR DON'T NEED TO BE HANDLED

bash-3.2$   export TEST =
bash: export: `=': not a valid identifier

bash-3.2$ export main.c
bash: export: `main.c': not a valid identifier

bash-3.2$ export (
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'

bash-3.2$ export )
bash: syntax error near unexpected token `)'



NON_GLOBAL ENV VAR:

TESTI --> shell thinks it's a command
TESTI= --> a variable without value, cannot be seen in env or export --> if this is exported, it can be seen on both env and export with empty value

export TESTI --> can be seen on export, but doesn't hhave a value, so can't be seen in env.


EMPTY EXPORT:


declare -x _="./a.out"
--> this can be seen with env, but not with export (without args)




CD:

bash: cd: HOME not set

Update OLDPWD env var before moving to new folder.
OLDPWD changes based on PWD, NOT based on CD.

CD can take as many arguments as possible, but ONLY THE FIRST ONE IS USED and others are totally discarded

cd /////// will take you to root. Also cd / / / /  works, because only first argument is used




PARSING:

echo & export at least can't handle "special tokens", so far I've found: < > ( ) 

If you only have one | (pipe), bash will read standard input until user inserts something + NL. NL alone won't stop the reading.

export TEST= hello world --> this is a valid input, no error, and sets TEST value to empty AND hello as null value AND world as null value variables

single and double quotations won't show in value
I mean:  export TEST='hello world' --> TEST=hello world in variable list

Unset works with multiple arguments (for example "unset USER PATH" is valid and unsets both of these var)

You can change global env var value without export!!!!
So after export TEST=testi, you can just say TEST=festi, and it changes

Unset without arguments does nothing.



SHLVL (the env var):

You can open a new bash inside bash!!
This var keeps track on the level of shell


ENV VAR expanding:

bash-3.2$ export PANU="echo hello"
bash-3.2$ $PANU
hello
bash-3.2$ export PANU=echo hello
bash-3.2$ $PANU

bash-3.2$ export PANU=>file1
bash-3.2$ echo hello $PANU



ECHO AND ENV VARIABLES:

TEST=     jee
bash-3.2$ echo $TEST
jee
ANOTHER ONE:
export TEST="     jee      jee  "
TEST=     jee      jee  
bash-3.2$ echo $TEST
jee jee
 --> so echo discards leading white spaces AND white spaces after word AND leaves only one space in between words
